# NoFicoLoan
This was a project for my first python class to come up with a project that I may continue to polish as I believe there is a need for something like this in the fintech space.
The scope of the project is to find a way to do lending to candidates that do not have a FICO credit history
Here is a link to my replit for a visual run of the code.
